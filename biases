"Thinking, Fast and Slow" by Daniel Kahneman is a book that explores various cognitive biases and the dual-process theory of human decision-making. While I can provide you with a list of some cognitive biases discussed in the book, ranking their day-to-day applicability may be subjective and dependent on individual experiences. However, I can still provide a general ranking based on common applicability. Here are several cognitive biases from the book, presented in no particular order:

1. Anchoring Bias: The tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information encountered when making decisions.
2. Availability Heuristic: The tendency to judge the likelihood of an event based on how easily it comes to mind.
3. Confirmation Bias: The tendency to search for, interpret, or favor information that confirms one's preexisting beliefs or hypotheses.
4. Halo Effect: The tendency to generalize an overall impression of a person based on a single characteristic or trait.
5. Framing Effect: The way information is presented (or "framed") can influence decision-making, leading to different outcomes based on how options are described.
6. Overconfidence Bias: The tendency to overestimate one's own abilities, knowledge, or the accuracy of one's beliefs.
7. Loss Aversion: The tendency to strongly prefer avoiding losses over acquiring equivalent gains.
8. Hindsight Bias: The inclination to see events as more predictable than they actually were before they occurred.
9. Recency Bias: The tendency to place more importance on the most recent information encountered and to overlook earlier data.
10. Sunk Cost Fallacy: The reluctance to abandon an investment or decision because one has already invested significant resources (e.g., time, money).

Now, based on general applicability, here's a ranking of these biases in terms of their day-to-day relevance:

1. Confirmation Bias
2. Availability Heuristic
3. Anchoring Bias
4. Framing Effect
5. Overconfidence Bias
6. Hindsight Bias
7. Recency Bias
8. Sunk Cost Fallacy
9. Loss Aversion
10. Halo Effect

Please note that this ranking is subjective and can vary depending on individual experiences and contexts. Additionally, there are numerous other cognitive biases not listed here that could also be relevant in day-to-day situations.
